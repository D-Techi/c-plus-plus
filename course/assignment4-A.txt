1. Constructors can have names different from their classes.

False. Constructors always have the same name as their class, as defined by C++ syntax.

2. Destructors have default arguments.

False. Destructors have no arguments, since they are called implicitly when the object is destroyed.

3. If a program uses the delete operator, a destructor is not needed.

False. The delete operator calls the destructor of the object it is deleting.

4. Explicit constructors need to be included in every class.

False. If you don't specify a constuctor, the compiler creates a default constructor. However, it is best to create a constructor that sets all the data members of the class to some sensible value.

5. Destructors are called each time an object goes out of existence.

True.

6. A class can have several default constructor functions.

True. You can use different constructors so that the object can be created with different parameters, if needed.

7. Constructors need to be declared for each class.

False. Constructors only need to be declared if the class constructor has parameters without a default value.

8. Constructors are automatically called when objects are created.

True.
